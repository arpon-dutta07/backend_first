// Developer Tools → Application → Cookies
// So cookies are stored in the browser, not in your backend.

// STEP 3: .json(...)
// This is the final step — it sends the whole response (with status, cookies, and JSON body) back to the browser.
// So:
// .status(200) → sets success code ✅
// .cookie(...) → attaches tokens ✅
// .json(...) → sends data ✅
//this is send to the frontend.
