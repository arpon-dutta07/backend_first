// "Hey browser, this request was successful (200)".
// 🧠 It doesn’t send anything yet — it just sets a label.
// 🧩 STEP 2: .cookie("accessToken", accessToken, options)
// Now this adds cookies to the same response object.
// 👉 It’s like saying:
// “Okay response, also attach this cookie before sending.”
// It’s still the same single response, you’re just adding extra things to it (like toppings on a pizza 🍕).
// Where this cookie is stored:
// When the browser receives the response:
// It checks if there are any cookies
// If yes → it stores them automatically in the browser’s “Cookies storage”
// 📍You can see them in:
// Developer Tools → Application → Cookies
// So cookies are stored in the browser, not in your backend.

// STEP 3: .json(...)
// This is the final step — it sends the whole response (with status, cookies, and JSON body) back to the browser.
// So:
// .status(200) → sets success code ✅
// .cookie(...) → attaches tokens ✅
// .json(...) → sends data ✅
//this is send to the frontend.
